    <p><b>Developer and video editor.</b></p>
    <p>Hi, I'm Ludka. I am a programmer who likes making small stuff in his free time, hoping to make it a full time job eventually. </p>
    <u>Stay tuned. I have some big plans for 2023</u>

    <p>You can find my, albeit lacklustre(for the time being), coding portfolio on my <a href="https://github.com/Katzadoo"> github</a></p>

      <summary>More about me</summary>
      <pre>
        From a young age, I've always been fascinated by technology, from
        anything electrical to the software inside, I always had a particular
        knack for tinkering and playing around with various devices

        I was notorious for deconstructing family devices and attempting to
        assemble various other things haha, but eventually I was able to harness
        my interest for technology and willingness to learn at a young age, to 
        propel myself into the fascinating world of how everything works.
        
        In school I took various afterschool clubs relating to programming and 
        robotics, as well as learning in my free time, however I found the most 
        enjoyment in robotics (the coding aspect), which we were actually quite
        good at.
        We got invited to a number of tournaments (sadly we were not good enough
        to win any lol) However I think that was around the time my love for
        programming truly awakened.

        The years following I made a few small programs here and there as I learnt
        the basics of coding in languages like Python and Java (Around this time
        I was able to create a basic website using html and css)
        
        And that leads us up to here. A student who is somewhat intermediate
        at programming. Sadly a lot of my time is taken up by school and work
        So I dont get as much time to work on side projects as I'd like. I 
        do freelance web development and professional video editing on the side,
        so my schedule gets pretty packed. Thanks for reading :D
